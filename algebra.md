# Introduction to the QEC algebra
In this document I will give an introduction to the Heisenberg picture, 
the stabilizer formalism, quantum circuit diagrams and some basic quantum error
correction codes.
## The Heisenberg notation & stabilizer formalism
- Look at operator evolution instead of state evolution
- By specifically looking at the evolution of operators to which system input 
are Eigenstates, we can follow superposition states through a quantum circuit
- Call Operators with +1 eigenvalue stabilizerss
