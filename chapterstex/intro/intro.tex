A quantum computer operates on so-called $qubits$, which can be
anything that can be put into a sufficiently uncertain superposition
state. Physical implementations of these include particles with 
spin, as well as controlled EM-waves, i.e. lasers.
In the following, we will give an overview of the utilized
algebra and pictures through which to view quantum information theory.

In the following we will analyze quantum circuit diagrams using the different
pictures of quantum mechanics.
A quantum circuit diagram is a visual representation of the computation done
in a quantum computer, whereby:
\begin{itemize}
	\item States progress in time along horizontal parallel lines
	\item Time goes from left to right
	\item Gates denoted X,Y,Z are the single qubit pauli operators
		$\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z$
	\item Gates can act on one or multiple qubits, whereby an X gate 
		on qubit 1 in a 3-qubit system should be interpreted as:
		\\$(X\otimes \mathbb{I} \otimes \mathbb{I}) (|\psi_1\rangle
		\otimes |\psi_2\rangle \otimes |\psi_3\rangle)$
\end{itemize}
