A quantum computer operates on so-called $qudits$, which can be
any multi-level quantum system. 
Physical implementations of these include particles with 
spin, as well as controlled EM waves, i.e. lasers. \\
In this thesis, we will
focus on \emph{qubit}-based systems, i.e. two-level quantum systems as base 
units of computation.

In this chapter, we will analyze a quantum circuit diagram using different
pictures of quantum mechanics, namely the Schroedinger and the Heisenberg picture.
A quantum circuit diagram is a visual representation of the computation done
in a quantum computer, whereby:
\begin{itemize}
	\item States progress in time along horizontal parallel lines
	\item Time goes from left to right
	\item what kind of gates?
	\item Gates denoted X, Y, Z are the single qubit Pauli operators
		$\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z$
    \item $M_{\{X,Y,Z\}^n}$ denotes an n qubit measurement of \{X,Y,Z\}
	\item Gates can act on one or multiple qubits, whereby an X gate 
		on qubit 1 in a 3-qubit system should be interpreted as
		\\$(X\otimes \mathbb{I} \otimes \mathbb{I}) |\psi_{1,2,3}\rangle$
\end{itemize}
