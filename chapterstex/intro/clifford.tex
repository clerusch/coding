\subsection{The Clifford Gates}

It has been proven in *reference source* that operators that 
map a state stabilized by some member of the Pauli-Group to 
a state stabilized by another member of the Pauli Group can be simulated efficiently
on a classical computer. The Group of operators that satisfy
this condition is called the Clifford Group.

For the decoder we wish to implement in
this thesis, it therefore makes sense to focus on those first and
foremost, as applying corrective gates is a computationally/
experimentally expensive task that should be put off until the latest
possible moment, and the propagation of an error until then can be
simulated efficiently. 

The Clifford Group can be generated by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Hadamard-Gate $H$, which performs single qubit
    basis changes from eigenstates of X to eigenstates of Z 
    and vice-versa:

    $H|+\rangle = |0\rangle$, $H|0\rangle = |+\rangle$,
    $H|-\rangle = |1\rangle$, $H|1\rangle = |-\rangle$
    
    \item The Phase-Gate $P$, which performs single qubit sign
    flips on the state parts which are $|1\rangle$ in the 
    computational basis:

    $
    P (\alpha|0\rangle \pm \beta |1\rangle) =
    \alpha|0\rangle \mp \beta |1\rangle
    $

    \item The CNOT-Gate, which on a two qubit system performs 
    an X gate on the second qubit if the first qubit is 
    $|1\rangle$, so maps:

    $
    \alpha |00\rangle + \beta |01\rangle + 
    \delta |10\rangle + \gamma |11\rangle \\
    \mapsto
    \alpha |00\rangle + \beta |01\rangle +
    \gamma |10\rangle + \delta |11\rangle
    $
\end{itemize}
In the $\sigma_z$-basis their matrix representations are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    \begin{math}
    H = 
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\left( 
    \begin{array}{cc}
       1 & 1 \\
       1 & -1 \\
    \end{array}
    \right)\end{math} 
;
    \begin{math}
    P = 
    \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & i \\
    \end{array}\right)
    \end{math}
    
    \item 
    \begin{math}
    CNOT = 
    \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{array}\right)
   \end{math} 
\end{itemize}
