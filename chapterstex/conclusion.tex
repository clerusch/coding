In this thesis, we gave an overview of existing
quantum codes as well as some decoding schemes.
The determined thresholds of ca. 16\% for the surface/toric code were
within the literature expected range(ADD REFERENCE). 
Their thresholds were however not distinguishable, and
especially for the cylindric code in future works, it might be of interest to 
calculate these thresholds more precisely by using more significant computational
resources.
The pseudo-threshold for the Steane code was found to be around $10^{-5}$, which is
the same as in the literature\cite{steaneThreshold}. 
While the lifting decoder for the hexagonal toric lattice color code did not produce
thresholdable output, it did work as a proof-of-concept on smaller error vectors as in
\ref{fig: lifting}.
Future work could include adapting a better cycle-finder algorithm for the lifted 
subgraph.
