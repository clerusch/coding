In this thesis, we gave an overview of existing
quantum codes as well as some decoding schemes.
The determined thresholds of $16.3\pm 0.5 \%$ for the surface code
and $16.0\pm0.5\%$ for the toric code were within single and threefold error margin
respectively to the literature values\cite{surfaceToricThreshold}. 
Their thresholds were however not distinguishable with great confidence, 
and especially for the cylindric code it might be of interest to 
calculate these thresholds more precisely by using more significant computational
resources in future works.
The pseudo-threshold for the Steane code was found to be around $10^{-5}$, which is
the same as in the literature\cite{steaneThreshold}. 
While the lifting decoder for the hexagonal toric lattice color code did not produce
thresholdable output, it did work as a proof-of-concept on smaller error vectors as in
\ref{fig: lifting}.
Future work could include adapting a better cycle-finder algorithm for the lifted 
subgraph.
