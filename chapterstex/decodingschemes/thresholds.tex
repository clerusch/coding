To compare different codes and decoding schemes
we introduce the concept of thresholds, whereby the threshold
of a specific code of scalable distance with a specific decoding 
scheme is defined as the physical error rate $per$ at which the logical
error rate becomes greater than $50\%$ in the limit of infinite 
distance. \\
Thresholds can vary depending on the error model, i.e. 
some codes can have a higher threshold for X than for Z errors.
For simplicity's sake in the following, we will assume equal 
X, Y and Z error rates of $\frac{per}{3}$.

Using this error model, we found a threshold of $x\pm y \%$ and
$z\pm q\%$ for the surface and toric code respectively.

On the color code, we found a threshold of $a\pm b\%$ using the 
lookup table decoder on the Steane code and $c\pm b\%$ using the 
lifting decoder for the scalable hexagonal toric color code.
