\subsubsection{MWPM decoding}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find a set of unmatched nodes that can be reached from the 
    matching by alternating between matched and unmatched edges. 
    Call these nodes "augmenting nodes".
    \item Find an augmenting path starting from each augmenting node,
    i.e. a path that starts and ends with an unmatched node, and
    alternates between matched and unmatched edges. 
    \item If such a path is found, flip all edges along it from matched
    to unmatched, and vice versa.
    \item Repeat until no augmenting path is found.
\end{enumerate}
