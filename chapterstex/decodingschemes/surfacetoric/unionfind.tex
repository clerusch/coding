\subsubsection{Union Find decoder}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize a cluster set for each syndrome node
    \item Grow each cluster by one edge in each direction
    \item Merge all clusters that share a node
    \item For all clusters with an even amount of syndrome nodes,
    perform MWPM within that cluster. Pop the found error edges from
    the graph.
    \item Repeat until all clusters are merged/discarded.
\end{enumerate}
