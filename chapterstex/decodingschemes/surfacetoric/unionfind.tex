\subsubsection{Union Find decoder}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize a cluster set for each syndrome node
    \item Grow each cluster by one edge in each direction
    \item Merge all clusters that share a node
    \item For all clusters with an even amount of syndrome nodes,
    perform MWPM within that cluster. Pop the found error edges from
    the graph.
    \item Repeat until all clusters are merged/discarded.
\end{enumerate}
While the union-find decoder is faster for small to medium
sized graphs and relatively simple to implement,
 it is not guaranteed to find a global optimum
and its performance degrades significantly for large
graphs and high error rates \cite{UFDecoder}.
For this reason, a MWPM algorithm was chosen for decoding the toric
subgraphs of the color code in our lifting decoder thresholding
in chapter \ref{sec: lifting}.
