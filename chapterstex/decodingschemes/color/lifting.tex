\subsubsection{Lifting decoder}\label{sec: lifting}
The Lifting decoder works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create dual of graph
    \item Generate single-edge-colored subgraphs of the dual
    \item Decode subgraphs using MWPM/Union-Find
    \item Unify all edges from subgraph corrections
    \item Find all shortest-length loops on this union
    \item All nodes bounded by the faces that are elements of the shortest-length loop sets
    are error nodes. 
    
\end{itemize}
