\subsection{Decoders for Surface/Toric codes}
The Syndromes on the surface/toric code are a set of nodes and
faces on the code graph. The node ancilla syndromes correspond to
Z errors, while the face ancilla syndromes correspond to X errors.
Since neighboring errors will trigger an ancilla that is between 
both errors twice, a chain of errors will only appear as two ancilla
syndrome bits being flipped at its borders.
The task of a decoding scheme for a surface/toric code is thus to
find the shortest paths between node pairs/face pairs, since the most likely
chain of errors to occur given a $<50\%$ physical error rate is the 
shortest one.\\
In practice, decoders for surface/toric codes only need to be able to
match nodes, since the matching of faces is just matching nodes on the 
dual graphs and the resulting data qubit errors can just be joined
(i.e. if an edge is found to have an error on both the X graph as well as the
dual Z graph, we know a Y error has occurred on that edge/data-qubit).
An example of a distance 5 surface code with two Z errors, one X error and
one Y error is shown in figure \ref{fig: surface_code}.
As with the ringcode, the decoding problem can be seen as either the
solution of equation \ref{eq: pcm} for a minimum weight $\vec{v}_{error}$
or as a graph matching problem.

\subsection{Color code decoders}
Unlike the surface and toric codes, in the color code the 
data qubits sit on the graphs nodes, and the ancillas on the 
graphs faces. Decoding the color code entails matching 
three differently colored faces to its enclosed nodes.
This is a significantly more challenging task than
decoding the 2D-codes, since three-colored graph matching is a confirmed
NP-hard problem. (reference delfosse paper)
