\subsubsection{Surface code}
We can therefore form a hypergraph product code of two repetition
codes for X error detection and Z error detection respectively,
obtaining the [[$d^2$,1,d]]``Surface-Code'' which can detect up
to d of $both$ X and Z errors, and 
therefore any pauli error happening.
We can draw this code as a graph, whereby the code's stabilizers
are understood as an adjacency Matrix, the data qubits are on 
edges of the graph and the ancilla qubits for Z-checks are on faces
while the ancilla qubits for X-checks lie on nodes.\\
Like the repetition code, the Surface code is a code that is regular until
it's boundary nodes.
