\subsection{Decoding schemes}
\subsubsection{Thresholds}
In order to compare different codes and decoding schemes,
we introduce the concept of thresholds.....

\subsubsection{Decoders for Surface/Toric codes}
\subsubsection{MWPM decoding}
\subsubsection{Union Find decoder}

\subsubsection{Color code decoders}

\subsubsection{Lookup table decoding}
This takes a long time to generate and cannot be done to scale,
but is a nice toy.

\subsection{Lifting decoder}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create dual of graph
    \item Generate single-edge-colored subgraphs of the dual
    \item Decode subgraphs using MWPM/Union-Find
    \item Unify all edges from subgraph corrections
    \item Find all loops on this
\end{itemize}
