\subsubsection{Surface code}
We can therefore form a hypergraph product code of two repetition
codes to
obtain the [[$d^2$,1,d]] ``Surface-Code'' which can detect up
to d of $both$ X and Z errors, and 
therefore any error happening \cite{joschka}.
We can draw this code as a graph, whereby the code's stabilizers
are understood as an adjacency Matrix of data to ancilla qubits.
Unlike in figure \ref{fig: surface_code}, it is possible to draw this 
graph without colors, by drawing it such that the data qubits are on 
edges of the graph and the ancilla qubits for Z-checks are on faces
while the ancilla qubits for X-checks lie on nodes.\\
Like the repetition code, the Surface code is a code that is regular until
its boundary nodes.
