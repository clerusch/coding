\subsubsection{Ringcode}
The ring code's graph essentially just loops around at the repetition
code's single-edged ancilla nodes, so for example its edge matrix where the nth row
represents which data qubit is connected to the nth ancilla
qubit.
This matrix for a three-qubit system looks like:
\begin{equation}
    M_{pc3} = \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            1 & 1 & 0\\
            0 & 1 & 1\\
            1 & 0 & 1\\
        \end{array}
        \right)
\end{equation}
