\subsection{Classical codes}
The concept of (classical) error-correcting codes (ECC) was
introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948.
Fundamentally, an ECC encodes $logical$ information within
a large superset of basic information carriers.
In the case of a classical computer, this means encoding a
bitstring within a system containing more physical bits
than the length of the encoded message, with the goal of message transmission
being resilient to some bits being faulty or subject to interference (i.e. EM-interference).

Two such classical ECCs are the repetition and the ring code.
We call these codes linear because their graph representations are
linear, or one-dimensional. In Quantum error correction, we speak of $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer
codes if an encoding scheme allows for $n$ physical qubits to 
encode $k$ logical qubits to an error distance of $d$, i.e. $d$ 
arbitrary individual errors being corrigible.
In the following, I will refer to linear or classical codes as having a 
distance of $\frac{1}{2}$, to indicate that they do not protect against an
arbitrary single-qubit error, but only against flips in one specific eigenbasis.
