\subsection{Classical codes}


Two known classical ECCs are the repetition and the ring code.
 In Quantum error correction, we speak of $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer
codes if an encoding scheme allows for $n$ physical qubits to 
encode $k$ logical qubits to an error distance of $d$, i.e. 
$\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor$ arbitrary individual errors being corrigible.

In the following, I will refer to the classical codes as having a 
distance of $\frac{1}{2}$, to indicate that they do not protect against an
arbitrary single-qubit error but only against flips in one specific eigenbasis.
