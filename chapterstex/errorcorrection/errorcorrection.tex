The concept of (classical) error-correcting codes (ECC) was
introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948 \cite{shannon}.
Fundamentally, an ECC encodes $logical$ information within
a large superset of basic information carriers.

In the case of a classical computer, this means encoding a
bitstring within a system containing more physical bits
than the length of the encoded message, with the goal of message transmission
being resilient to some bits being faulty or subject to interference (i.e. EM-interference).

Analogously, in the case of a quantum computer this means encoding a \emph{logical}
qubit within a system of multiple qubits, with a similar goal of resilience towards
errors caused by external influences.

In this chapter, we will give an overview of different quantum error correction codes,
starting with adaptations of classical codes.
