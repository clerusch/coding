\subsection{1D/ Linear codes}
From classical computer science there are well known existing
encoding schemes, such as the repetition and ring code.
We call these codes linear because their graph representations are
linear, or one-dimensional. In Quantum error correction, we speak of $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer
codes if an encoding scheme allows for $n$ physical qubits to 
encode $k$ logical qubits to an error distance of $d$, i.e. $d$ individual errors 
being corrigible.
In the following I will refer to linear or classical codes as having a 
distance of $\frac{1}{2}$, to indicate that they do not protect against an
arbitrary single qubit error, but only against flips in one specific eigenbasis.
