# General
Add outlook paragraph to every chapter beginning.
Quantum error correction zoo
# Abstract
- We introduce stabilizer formalism and qec circuits
- Mention that could reproduce thresholds
# Quantum Algebra (rename algebra?)
- Schroedinger
- Heisenberg
    - Stabilizers
    - Gates
    - Measurements (include probabilites)
    - Example Circuit analysis
- Clifford Gates (cite why error correction before non clifford gate)
move clifford to effect of gate on stabilizers

# Error detection and correction
- Classical codes (cite shannon paper)
    - ring code (add pcm to figure)
    - rep code
- Quantum error model
- 2D codes
    - Surface code (distance is different)
    - Toric code (2d)
    - Color code (cite figure origin)

# Decoding schemes
- Add figure with syndrome on surface/torus with normal drawing way

- Decoders for surface/toric codes
    - MWPM decoding
    - Union find decoding
- Color code decoders
    - Lookup table decoding
    - Lfting decoding (just check if the sum of error and estimation leaves a syndrome & somehow if logical error happened, also add that only perfect matching is NP-Hard)
- Thresholds (include cylinder threshold and mention computation of error bars)

# Conclusion
- mention sucessful reproduction of thresholds
- include future works tahat i would like to do
